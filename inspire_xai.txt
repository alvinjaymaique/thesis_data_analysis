ABSTRACT
This research integrates Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) into cyber-physical anomaly detection frameworks for power quality monitoring across Cebu, Philippines. Using intelligent sensor networks deployed across 12 sites, we collected over 3 million data points which were reduced to a representative 20,000-sample dataset with 10 electrical features. K-Means clustering with k=15 achieved optimal performance (Silhouette Score: 0.5321, Calinski-Harabasz Index: 17239.31) in identifying distinct operational states. For classification, Random Forest achieved 99.73% accuracy with superior computational efficiency compared to other models. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis revealed voltage, voltage deviation, power factor deviation, power factor, and frequency as the most influential parameters for anomaly detection. The 15 discovered clusters were categorized into 11 "True Anomalies" requiring intervention and 4 "Operational Anomalies" representing stable conditions. Location-specific patterns were identified: Lorega experienced primarily voltage-related problems, Tugas showed power factor irregularities, and Bato exhibited unexpected frequency-related anomalies. TreeExplainer demonstrated perfect stability (1.0000) for interpretability. This XAI-enhanced framework transforms "black box" anomaly detection into interpretable insights, enabling targeted infrastructure optimization and preventive maintenance. The system improves power quality monitoring with enhanced transparency and stakeholder trust, ultimately contributing to more efficient power distribution throughout Cebu.

INTRODUCTION
Power quality is essential for ensuring the reliability and stability of power distribution systems, especially in regions like Cebu where quality electricity is crucial for economic and social activities. Traditional power quality monitoring methods often fail to detect real-time anomalies and lack adaptability to dynamic data patterns, making it difficult for utility providers to take proactive measures. While machine learning (ML) integration in power systems has advanced rapidly through improved computational capabilities, most implementations operate as "black boxes," hindering stakeholders from understanding the decision-making process.

This lack of transparency creates a trust deficit among stakeholders in the energy sector, where accountability and reliability are paramount. Each anomaly detection decision can significantly affect safety and operational efficiency, making model interpretability a serious challenge. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a solution to enhance ML model transparency, enabling utility operators to gain insights into model operations without sacrificing performance.

This study integrates XAI, specifically the Shapley approach, into anomaly detection within cyber-physical systems for power quality monitoring in selected areas of Cebu, Philippines. Unlike traditional approaches that simply flag anomalies, this research explains why anomalies occur, transforming complex machine learning models from "black boxes" into interpretable tools that foster stakeholder confidence and enable informed decision-making.

STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM
The rapid adoption of machine learning models for anomaly detection in power distribution systems has led to a significant challenge: many of these models are difficult to interpret and understand. This lack of transparency creates barriers for stakeholders and utility providers who cannot fully comprehend the reasons behind detected anomalies, undermining trust in AI-driven decisions. Traditional methods of anomaly detection lack precision and fail to provide actionable insights, further limiting the effectiveness of power management strategies. The problem addressed by this study is the lack of interpretability and transparency in AI-driven anomaly detection models integrated into power distribution systems in Cebu, Philippines.

OBJECTIVE
This study aims to enhance power distribution at selected utilities in Cebu, Philippines by integrating Explainable AI into anomaly detection models. Specifically, it seeks to:

Identify the critical electrical parameters that cause anomalies through XAI, specifically using Shapley values
Develop XAI techniques to make detected anomalies more interpretable and explainable
Evaluate the performance of the integrated system in actual operation
SCOPE AND LIMITATION
This research focuses on integrating XAI into cyber-physical anomaly detection in intelligent sensor networks for power quality monitoring within specific areas of Cebu, Philippines. The study is limited to the deployed IoT-based sensor networks of the collaborative research group, and findings may not be generalizable to other areas or sensor types. The research does not consider downtime such as Wi-Fi outages during data collection or transmission, which may impact data accuracy and completeness. The study assumes households where sensor networks are installed have stable internet connections for real-time data transmission. Harmonics and overload anomalies are excluded from the clustering and classification processes due to sensor sampling rate limitations.

METHODOLOGY
System Architecture and Data Collection
The study deployed intelligent sensor networks across 12 sites in Cebu, Philippines, monitoring key electrical parameters including voltage, current, frequency, power, and power factor. The system architecture consists of three primary layers:

Hardware Layer: ESP32 microcontrollers and PZEM-004T sensors for data acquisition
Cloud Layer: Firebase Realtime Database for data storage and transmission
Analytics Layer: ML models for anomaly detection and XAI for interpretation
Data was collected in real-time and securely transmitted via Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to the cloud database. A strategic data reduction approach was implemented to address the large volume of data while preserving meaningful patterns and anomalies.

Feature Engineering and Data Processing
Raw electrical parameters were supplemented with derived features to enhance anomaly detection capabilities:

Table 1. Raw and Derived Features Used in Clustering and Classification

Raw Features	Derived Features
Voltage	Voltage deviation
Current	Frequency deviation
Frequency	Power factor deviation
Power	Power-voltage ratio
Power factor	Current-voltage ratio
This comprehensive feature set enabled the capture of normal operating conditions and various types of anomalies, including voltage surges, dips, and power factor issues.

Clustering and Classification
Five clustering algorithms were evaluated to identify natural groupings in the electrical parameter data:

K-Means
Spectral Clustering
Ward Hierarchical Clustering
Agglomerative Clustering
Gaussian Mixture Models
Each algorithm was assessed using Silhouette Coefficient Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and Calinski-Harabasz Index to determine optimal cluster count and quality.

For supervised classification, multiple models were implemented and evaluated:

Decision Trees
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
XAI Integration
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis was applied to provide both global and local explanations for detected anomalies. Three SHAP explainers—TreeExplainer, KernelExplainer, and DeepExplainer—were evaluated based on consistency, stability, and compacity metrics.
